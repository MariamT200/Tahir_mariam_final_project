# Tahir_mariam_final_project
This project includes a bunch of different snippets of code in order to fufill the requirements I had left on my checklist
- First I started by implementing sys.argv commands
- then i created a list of numbers in order to append and remove items from it
- then I created a function where I append and remove items from a list through a loop
- Then I created a tuple
- then i created a dimple math funtion in order to use a tuple to return multiple values from it
- then i created a dictionary and iterated through items in order to access both the keys and values
- then i updated the values in the dictionary
- then i created a small program where users can input a file path to a file with text they want to turn into a list. This is the only part of my code where the user must enter in info 
I tried my best to acomplish multiple checklist items in one snippet of code so my project wan't too messy, however it is still a little random.
